# Taylor series for f(x)=ln(x)

###### Task is to write a procedure that determines the value of the n-th expansion in the power series of a given function at the given point x.

Using this procedure, write two scripts:
* The first script is to write (e.g. in the form of a table) the expansion values, the absolute and relative error of determining the function value for n = 0,1,2, ..., 10 and x = 0.5.
* The second script is to present the expanded functions and three selected expansions (e.g. 3, 6, 9) for x âˆˆ (0.1) on a common graph.

NOTE: In the 'expand (n, x)' procedure you must not use the loop statement
